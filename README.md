Queue Lab  
This is an independent lab.  

A queue is a FIFO structure. Similar to standing in line in the cafeteria, the first person in the line, is the first person to move out of the line and be served. In this lab, complete the queue class methods of push() and pop() to reflect the first in first out behavior when adding and removing cards from a deck of cards.
